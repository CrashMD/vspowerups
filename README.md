## Description

The purchase price of power ups in Vampire Survivors depends on the order in which they are bought.

This app calculates the minimum gold price for any combination of power ups, and shows
in what order to buy the power ups to get that minimum price.

For example, the minimum price to buy all the power ups is 167,020 gold, if they are bought in the
order shown:
