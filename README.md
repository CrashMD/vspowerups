# Vampire Survivors Power Up Optimizer

## Usage

Download [vsoptimizer.py](https://github.com/jbchouinard/vspowerups/releases/download/v0.2.8.2/vsoptimizer.py) and run with Python 3.7+.

## Description

The purchase price of power ups in Vampire Survivors depends on the order in which they are bought.
Since each upgrade increases the price of all other powerups, you want to buy the most expensive
ones first.

This app calculates the minium gold price of any particular power up setup you might want, and shows
in what order to buy the power ups to get that minimum price.

If you have at least 97,140 gold or more, you can buy all the Power Ups:
